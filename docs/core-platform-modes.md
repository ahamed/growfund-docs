# Core Platform Modes

Growfund offers two distinct operational modes that determine how your fundraising platform functions. Understanding the differences between these modes is crucial for setting up your fundraising platform correctly.

## Overview

Growfund operates in two modes:

1. **Campaign Mode**: Reward-based crowdfunding with pledges and rewards
2. **Donation Mode**: Direct donations without rewards

You can only use one mode at a time for your entire platform. The mode you choose affects the features available, the user experience, and how funds are collected.

## Campaign Mode

Campaign Mode is designed for reward-based crowdfunding where supporters make pledges in exchange for rewards or perks.

### Key Features

- **Pledges**: Supporters make pledges toward campaigns with funding goals
- **Rewards**: Campaign creators offer multiple reward tiers with different pledge amounts
- **Backers**: Supporters who make pledges are called "backers"
- **Funding Goals**: Campaigns have specific funding goals and deadlines
- **Reward Fulfillment**: Campaign creators fulfill rewards after successful campaigns

### Use Cases

Campaign Mode is ideal for:
- **Product Launches**: Pre-sell products or launch new items

## Switching Modes

You can switch between modes after initial setup, but consider the following:

### Important Considerations

- **Existing Data**: Switching modes may affect existing campaigns or donations
- **User Experience**: The interface and features change based on the selected mode

   - Go to **Growfund** > **Settings** > **General**
   - Find the **Platform Mode** option

2. **Select New Mode**
   - Choose **Campaign Mode** or **Donation Mode**
   - Click **Save Changes**

3. **Verify Changes**
